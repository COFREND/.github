Founded in 1967, **COFREND** - the French Confederation for Non-destructive Testing - is the reference body in certifying and qualifying non-destructive testing operators in France.

This multi-sectoral interprofessional confederation brings together all persons involved in **NDT**: industrialists, equipment manufacturers and distributors, professional associations, certified operators, research and training bodies, service providers and public institutions (Chambers of Commerce, Standardization, Ministries, Educationâ€¦).
COFREND is accredited by the French Ministry of Environment, Energy and Sea, which is in charge of international climate relations, under the Pressure Equipment Directive, for the approval of personnel in charge of non-destructive testing of permanent assemblies.

COFREND runs, promotes and represents the French **NDT network** through its five competence hubs. The missions are split between competence hubs and bring together members representing the various branches of NDT professional and expert activities.
There are more than 350 volunteers working to promote NDT through COFREND.

COFREND fosters and coordinates the development of **research and exchanges of scientific experiences and information** both in France and internationally. Focused on strategic NDT topics, the Working Groups comprise several members split according to techniques or methods. The work can culminate in:
-	Normative recommendations,
-	New COFREND certification projects,
-	Publication of technical specifications, Recommanded Practices deploying new technologies
-	Experts presentations at scientific conferences in France and abroad
